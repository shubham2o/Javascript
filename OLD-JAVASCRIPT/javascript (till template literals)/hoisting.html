        <p>With <strong>var</strong>, you can use a variable before it is declared:</p>
        <p id="demo"></p>

        <!-- Variables defined with var are hoisted to the top

            Meaning: You can use the variable before it is declared: -->

        <script>
            carName="Volvo";
            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = carName;
            var carName;
        </script>

        <!-- Variables defined with let are also hoisted to the 
            top of the block, but not initialized.
            Meaning: Using a let variable before it is declared will 
            result in a ReferenceError: -->
