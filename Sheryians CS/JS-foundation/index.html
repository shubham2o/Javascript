      3. Just in Time compiler uses Interpreter to solve task fast and uses
      normal compiler to run fast.

      5. Primitive Data Types - String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, null,
      undefined, and symbol.

    <h4>6. Reference Data Types - Array [ ], Objects { }, and function ( ).</h4>
    <hr />

    <h4>
      7. When using Reference Data Types, if you want to make a clone or a copy
      of one variable value, then with the help of spread operator [...
      variableName] you can do this. In short, if you want to convert reference
      data types into the primitive data types, then use spread operator.

      9. Loops means repetition. Types of Loops - for loop, while loop, do-while
      loop, for-in loop, for-of loop, for-each loop. foreach loop works only on
      arrays, and is used to loop through each key / value pair in an array.

      10. In Javascript, function are reusable block of code that helps us to
      perform a specific task. ES5 has three types of functions - 1. function
      statements, 2. function expressions, 3. Anonymous functions. ES6 has only
      one type - 1. Fat Arrow functions.

      11. undefined is a value. It is a value given to a variable when there is

      17. Synchronous Code always run line by line. Asynchronous Code does not
