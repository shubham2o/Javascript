      2. Compiler - Machine Code - Solves task slowly but runs fast - C++, Java

    <h4>
      3. Just in Time compiler uses Interpreter to solve task fast and uses
      normal compiler to run fast.

      JavaScript uses V8 for Google Chrome and Node.js. SpiderMonkey for Mozilla
      Firefox. JavaScriptCore for Apple's Safari. <br />
      Python uses PyPy JIT. <br />

      5. Primitive Data Types - String, Number, BigInt, Boolean, null,
      undefined, and symbol.
    </h4>
    <hr />

    <h4>6. Reference Data Types - Array [ ], Objects { }, and function ( ).</h4>
    <hr />

    <h4>
      7. When using Reference Data Types, if you want to make a clone or a copy
      of one variable value, then with the help of spread operator [...
      variableName] you can do this. In short, if you want to convert reference
      data types into the primitive data types, then use spread operator.

      9. Loops means repetition. Types of Loops - for loop, while loop, do-while
      loop, for-in loop, for-of loop, for-each loop. foreach loop works only on
      arrays, and is used to loop through each key / value pair in an array.

      10. In Javascript, function are reusable block of code that helps us to
      perform a specific task. ES5 has three types of functions - 1. function
      statements, 2. function expressions, 3. Anonymous functions. ES6 has only
      one type - 1. Fat Arrow functions
