        <h2>JavaScript Data Types are Dynamic</h2>
        <p>JavaScript has dynamic types. This means that the same 
            variable can be used to hold different data types:
        </p>

        <p id="demo"></p>

        <script>
            let x;  // Now x is undefined
            x = 5;  // Now x is 5
            x = "Shubham";  // Now x is Shubham

            document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = x;
        </script>
    </body>
